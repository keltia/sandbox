Go library to create & manage lightweight sandboxes (like temporary files).

## Requirements

* Go >= 1.10

## Installation

This is a pure library, there is no associated command..

Installation is like many Go libraries with a simple

    go get github.com/keltia/sandbox

`sandbox` also has `vgo` support & metadata (see the articles on [vgo](https://research.swtch.com/vgo-intro)).  It respects the [Semantic Versioning](https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import) principle with tagged releases.

You can thus use

    vgo install github.com/keltia/sandbox

to install the library.

## API Usage

    snd, err := sandbox.New("foo")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("can not create sandbox: %v", err)
    }
    defer snd.Cleanup()

    snd.Enter()
    snd.Exit()

## License

This is under the 2-Clause BSD license, see `LICENSE.md`.

## History

I originally wrote this code for various projects of mine and have re-used it enough time to think about putting it into its own module.
